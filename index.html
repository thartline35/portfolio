  <h3></h3>
  <p>
    I'm a senior technology leader specializing in <strong>large-scale engineering operations and AI training initiatives</strong>, 
    with proven experience directly managing <strong>150+ Engineering Quality Managers and Consultants</strong> across all 
    technological stacks. My leadership expertise centers on preparing and developing management teams to oversee 
    <strong>up to 3,000+ engineers</strong> focused on quality assurance and delivery for data annotation and AI training 
    in software engineering domains. This operational leadership is complemented by a 
    <strong>Summa Cum Laude Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> with a concentration in Data Analysis 
    and Program Management, earned in just 27 months while working full-time and managing home responsibilities 
    with my husband for our three daughters.
  </p>
  <p>
    My leadership foundation was built through <strong>15+ years of management and organizational leadership experience</strong> 
    (2004-2019), including roles as Branch and Regional Loan Office Manager and President and Coach of a youth 
    cheerleading league serving 125+ participants. After making a strategic pivot to technology in 2020, 
    I rapidly scaled from individual contributor to <strong>enterprise-level engineering operations leadership</strong>. 
    This unique combination of business leadership, large-scale team management, and deep technical expertise 
    enables me to <strong>architect both technical solutions and organizational systems</strong> that deliver results at scale.
  </p>
  <p>
    At <strong>Scale AI</strong>, I demonstrated exceptional ability to <strong>scale engineering quality operations</strong>—
    advancing to lead comprehensive management structures spanning multiple technological domains. My approach combines 
    <strong>strategic organizational design with hands-on technical mentorship</strong>, successfully developing management 
    frameworks that ensure quality and delivery across thousands of engineering contributors. This work directly supported 
    AI training initiatives and software engineering data annotation projects, requiring deep understanding of both 
    technical excellence and large-scale operational coordination. Additional achievements include developing comprehensive 
    data visualization systems that elevated SNHU's sustainability initiatives to Silver status and delivering an 
    innovative MVP during my internship with <strong>Girls Who Code Leadership Academy</strong> hosted by 
    <strong>RTX (Raytheon Technologies)</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My technical leadership philosophy centers on <strong>building scalable systems for both technology and people</strong>. 
    With advanced skills in <strong>Python, SQL, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, React, and the Microsoft Power Platform</strong>, 
    I excel at designing technical architectures while simultaneously developing organizational structures that can 
    manage complex, multi-domain engineering initiatives. My expertise in Agile methodologies and enterprise-scale 
    team leadership enables me to translate strategic technical visions into executable frameworks that drive quality 
    and delivery across diverse technological stacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    What distinguishes my leadership approach is the ability to <strong>architect scalable solutions for both technical 
    and organizational challenges</strong>—whether designing quality assurance frameworks for AI training pipelines, 
    developing management structures for cross-stack engineering teams, or establishing data-driven decision frameworks 
    that operate effectively across thousands of contributors. I lead with strategic vision while maintaining operational 
    precision, creating environments where large-scale technical excellence becomes systematically achievable.
